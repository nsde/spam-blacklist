A list of annoying SEO domains to block in your search engine. Examples include websites with poor/no actual content other than keywords and ads.
This is **especially** useful for smaller search engines such as *DuckDuckGo* or *Brave Search*!

Feel free to use this list in your project in any way! You are totally welcome to create your own search engine and use my list in it.

## About this project
I've noticed how some search results in *DuckDuckGo* - the search engine I'm currently frequently using (aside from *Brave Search*) - are actually just spam websites filled with keywords built to earn money using ads.

### This project's goal
I want to save others quite some time :)
