### 💡 Best support for: downloads, apps, gaming, programming, multimedia, VPNs, proxies · 🇺🇸 & 🇩🇪 websites
### ⛔ Currently blocks 155+ annoying or even harmful sites! · Made for: *uBlacklist*

###### This project is not made, endorsed, sponsored or affiliated with uBlacklist or its developers

A list of annoying SEO domains to block in your search engine. Examples include websites with poor/no actual content other than keywords and ads.
Not only can this blacklist protect your time and nerves, but is also great to block adware, malware and other types of badware.

Feel free to use this list in your project in any way! You are totally welcome to create your own search engine and use my list in it.

## About this project
I've noticed how some search results in *DuckDuckGo* - the search engine I'm currently frequently using (aside from *Brave Search*) - are actually just spam websites filled with keywords built to earn money using ads.

### This project's goal
I want to save others quite some time and effort as well as protect them from as ads, malware and phishing.

## uBlacklist Info
