# 🚮 Spam Sites Filterlist/Blacklist (get rid of Malware & Adware!)
### 💡 Topics: downloads, apps, gaming, programming · 🇺🇸 & 🇩🇪 websites
### ⛔ Currently blocks 84+ annoying sites! · Made for: *uBlacklist*

###### This project is not made, endorsed, sponsored or affiliated with uBlacklist or its developers

A list of annoying SEO domains to block in your search engine. Examples include websites with poor/no actual content other than keywords and ads.
This is **especially** useful for smaller search engines such as *DuckDuckGo* or *Brave Search*!

Feel free to use this list in your project in any way! You are totally welcome to create your own search engine and use my list in it.

## About this project
I've noticed how some search results in *DuckDuckGo* - the search engine I'm currently frequently using (aside from *Brave Search*) - are actually just spam websites filled with keywords built to earn money using ads.

### This project's goal
I want to save others quite some time :)
